# Notes-App

## Assignment for SDE 1 - Frontend

### Objective -
Create an online note making app where users can write notes.

### Application overview -
       - Users  should be able to create notes for any day, edit, and delete them. They should also be able to add a date while creating a note.
       - Users should also be able to sort the notes (newest first and oldest first), search the notes,  and apply filters (week wise, month wise, and year wise)
#### Note: No need to store the notes data in local storage. It can be stored in a state.

      - Use ReactJS to build the app
      - Create multiple components instead of a single component
      - Using typescript is a plus but not mandatory
